## What I do
- Review OpenCode server docs for connection, configuration, and debugging guidance.
- Read SDK docs for integration patterns, APIs, and workflow updates.
- Summarize relevant findings with links and practical troubleshooting steps.

## When to use me
Use this when you need to diagnose issues communicating with OpenCode servers or implement SDK features.
Ask clarifying questions if you need focus on a specific endpoint, transport, or SDK language.
